'''A constant is like a variable whose value stays the same throughout the life 
of a program. Python doesn't have built-in constant types, but Python programmers use all capital letters to indicate a variable should be treated as a 
constant and never be changed:'''

MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000

'''When you want to treat a variable as a constant in your code, make the 
name of the variable all capital letters.'''
